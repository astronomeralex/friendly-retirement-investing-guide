Alex's Friendly Retirement Guide

Disclaimer -- this is a guide I put together from my own learning and with the help of some friends. I'm not a financial professional and everything herein should be taken with a grain of salt. However, I do hope it is useful.

Please open a bug or file a pull request to change or add more information.

The guide is written in markdown. Take a look at [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) for a nice markdown reader.
