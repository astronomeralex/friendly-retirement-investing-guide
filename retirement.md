### Why Care about Retirement?



### Before You Start Investing

1. **Make a budget** 
2. **Pay off high-interest debt.** The average return rate for the US stock market is 4-8%. Since many credit cards charge usurious interest rates of 10%, 20%, or even 30%, it's important to pay off credit card debt as quickly as possible.
3. Have a rainy day fund.
4. Get an idea of your risk tolerance for investing.

### Types of Retirement Plans
* #### Social Security
	* US Government retirement and disability program funded by payroll taxes.
	* Social Security now makes up over a third of the US Government budget.
	* Almost all jobs, except for some teachers, academics, and others with public pension plans, pay into social security. Benefits are based on the amount and time paid into the program.
	* Designed to keep retired folks out of poverty, not fund a luxurious retirement.
	* The longer in retirement you wait to start drawing social security, the higher your payments will be (increases 8% per year until age 70).
	
 	* ##### Positives
		* Guaranteed income throughout retirement.
	* ##### Negatives
		* Generally doesn't provide the necessary income for a comfortable retirement.
	* ##### Information
		* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States))
		* [Social Security Agency](http://www.ssa.gov/)
		
* #### Pensions
	* Mostly in the public sector, academia, and in some unions; many private employers have gotten rid of pensions.
	* Pensions traditionally pay a "defined benefit" once you retire based on your salary and how long you paid into the pension; that is, a set amount of money, with increases for inflation, per year for the rest of your life. For example, a PA teacher at retirement will receive a yearly income of 0.025 x [highest salary] x [years of service].
	
	* ##### Positives
		* Pensions provide security throughout retirement regardless of lifespan. This provides a very high level of financial security that does not vary with the stock market.
	
	* ##### Negatives
		* Generally, pensions are not very portable, and can't move from job to job, like IRAs or 401(k) plans. 
		* Some pension plans, particularly municipal, are very underfunded; For example --  [Detroit](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-05/detroit-pension-cuts-from-bankruptcy-prompt-cries-of-betrayal).
		* May or may not provide survivor benefits.

* #### 401(k), 403(b), and the Thrift Savings Plan
	* 401ks are retirement plans used by a large majority of businesses. They are named after the subsection of the IRS code which defines them.
	* 403b plans are used by some non-profits and academia; they are also named after their subsection of the tax code.
	* Many companies will match retirement contributions up to a certain percentage (generally 3-6%) -- this is equivalent to a large bonus!
	* The Thrift Savings Plan is the Federal Government's version of this.
	* Generally, money comes out of paychecks and into the plans pre-tax; tax is paid when the money is taken out during retirement. Maximum pre-tax contribution per year is ~$18,000. Recently, there are post-tax versions of these plans similar to a Roth IRA (see below). These Roth versions have significantly lower contribution limits, but there are no taxes paid when the money is withdrawn.
	* Cannot withdraw money out of these plans until age 59.5 or financial hardship.
	
	* ##### Positives
		* Many 401ks or 403bs will offer investment funds from one financial company. You can choose your own level of risk for your situation.
		* Very portable and easy to transfer to another company or into an IRA.
	
	* ##### Negatives
		* Many 401ks or 403bs will offer investment funds from one financial company. These could be non-optimal for your situation or have higher fees than other financial firms.
		* Value depends on market conditions.
	* ##### Information
		* Wikipedia on [401(k)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401%28k%29) and [403(b)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/403(b\)) 
		* [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/401kandCos/)
* #### Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
	* IRAs are individual accounts not connected with any company.
	* There are two main types: traditional and Roth.
	* Traditional IRAs take money out of your paycheck pre-tax, and the money is taxed when withdrawn during retirement.
	* Roth IRAs take money out of your paycheck post-tax, and the money is never taxed again. All the gains from increases in your investments are untaxed. *Roth IRAs are a financial miracle.*
	* Like 401ks and 403bs, you cannot withdraw money out of IRAs until age 59.5 or financial hardship. You can withdraw up to $10,000 of principle from a Roth once in your life to buy a house.
	* Contributions to IRAs are limited to $5500 per year total, not each type of account. 
	
	* ##### Positives
		* Portable, doesn't depend your workplace, and open to a very broad range of investments. 
		* The tax benefits of IRAs are very significant.
	* ##### Negatives
		* Value depends on market conditions.

### Investment Strategies

* #### Passive Investing
Passive investing (also called index investing) buys into large portions of the market using index funds or other low-cost investing options. There is no attempt to use market timing or stock picking. **This strategy has been shown to be superior to active investing strategies and is highly recommended.** See [Standard & Poor's Index Vs. Active Scorcard](https://us.spindices.com/resource-center/thought-leadership/spiva/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_management) for more information.

* #### Active Investing
Active investing is where the investor attempts to make money by picking specific stocks or sectors of the market that they believe will perform better than the market. If correct, this can lead to large gains. However, it turns out that active investors generally perform significantly worse than passive investors. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_management) for more details.

* #### Asset Allocation
Asset allocation is a general investment strategy that works particularly well when paired with passive investing. Asset allocation balances risk and growth by adjusting the assets in a portfolio to work with the investor's risk tolerance and investment timeline. For example, as you approach retirement, your portfolio should shift to less risky investments such as bond funds, as opposed to stocks, which have a greater potential for growth, but can also loose significant value quickly. More information is available from [Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-risk), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_allocation), and [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/basics_basics.moneymag/index3.htm?iid=EL).

* #### Rebalancing
Portfolio rebalancing is a technique to keep your asset allocation in line. For example, if stocks have a great year, the monetary gain will make stocks a have a larger allocation of your portfolio than you specified. This means that your portfolio has more risk than you would like. So, you sell some stocks, and buy more bonds, or other sectors of your portfolio that are now underweighted. It's debated how often to rebalance your portfolio; yearly seems like a reasonable option. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebalancing_investments) or [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/05/051105.asp) for more information.

### Investment Options

* #### Stocks
Buying a share of a company's stock is to own a very small part of the company. Stock price goes up and down with supply and demand. As the company grows, or its potential for growth grows, the stock price increases. As it declines in value or the potential to decline in value increases, its stock price goes down. The company may also share its profits in the form of a dividend, which is paid to the investors per share of stock they own.  
**Owning individual stocks is very risky and not recommended.** Consider Enron, and many of the other companies that were "amazing investments" until they went out of business, leaving their stock worth nothing. However, as we'll discuss below in Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds, there are ways to buy into hundreds or thousands of companies, giving the growth of stocks without the drawback of individual companies.  
See [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/investing_stocks.moneymag/index.htm) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock) for more information on stocks.  

* #### Bonds
A bond is a loan to a company, government, or municipality. A specific bond will have a maturity (length of time until you get the principal back) and will give payments at a particular interest rate over the life of the bond. The riskier the bond, the higher the interest rate, and the higher the chance that the company won't pay it back.  
While generally less risky than stocks, bonds also have less growth potential. Owning individual bonds is also not recommended as the fees to buy are expensive and it's difficult to do enough research to make sure a specific bond is a good buy.  Individual bonds increase in price  (on the secondary market) when interest rates decrease, and visa versa.
As with stocks, there are mutual funds and exchange traded funds that allow you to buy into large sections of the bond market with one fund.  
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance\)) and [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/investing_bonds.moneymag/index.htm?iid=EL) for more information. 

* #### Certificates of Deposit
Certificates of deposit are money loaned to a bank or other financial agency for a specific amount of time at an agreed upon interest rate. Generally the longer the time period, the higher the interest rate. These are very low risk, as they are generally insured by the [FDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation). However, the trade-off is that interest rates are very low, and usually don't even beat inflation. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit) for more information.

* #### Commodities
Commodities trading investing in funds that trade in primary products, such as gold, silver, wheat, sugar, coffee, etc. **Commodities are generally very risky and not recommended.** Unlike stocks or bonds, commodities don't pay out dividends or interest. While commodities many increase in value during a market downturn (or if there are shortages), they are not generally good long term investments.

* #### Real Estate
Owning real estate can be an excellent buffer against inflation and can generate large growth, particularly during housing booms. However, investing in a particular piece of land is very risky, just like buying into a specific stock or bond. There are specific mutual funds and exchange traded funds called Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) that are very broad investments in real estate and real estate companies.

* #### Mutual Funds
Its very hard to diversify a portfolio by buying into many individual stocks. Mutual funds are great because by buying into one mutual fund, you are pooling your money with other investors to buy into hundreds or thousands of companies. There are also mutual funds for bonds, or a combination of stocks and bonds. Mutual funds can be actively or passively managed, as discussed above. There are many many many different mutual funds that have different strategies or focus on specific areas of the market.  
All this diversification comes at a cost -- fees. Mutual funds charge fees by taking a percentage from your mutual fund's value. **It is very important to have low fee funds** for maximum growth. Fees for the same type of mutual fund can vary by a factor of 20, so it's important to do your homework.  
For starting off saving for retirement, consider all-in-one retirement funds, such as [Vanguard Target Retirement](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/). These funds have very low fees and change asset allocation over time, so the closer you get to retirement, the less risky your investments are.  
For more information on mutual funds, see [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/investing_mutualfunds.moneymag/index.htm?iid=EL) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund).

* #### Exchange Traded Funds
Exchange traded funds, usually called ETFs, are very similar to mutual funds. A single ETF invests in many companies or bonds or commodities. However, unlike mutual funds, ETFs trade on the market like stocks. They can also have slightly lower fees than mutual funds. Many online brokerage firms (such as TD Ameritrade and Scottrade) have a subset of common ETFs that are commission-free to buy into.  
For more information see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund) or [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/investing_ETFs.moneymag/index.htm?iid=EL).

* #### Index Funds
**Index funds are awesome**. Index funds are a subset of mutual funds and ETFs that are the backbone for a passive investing strategy. Index funds aim to track a specific market index, which is usually a collection of stocks or bonds. Common indexes include the S&P 500, the FTSE 100, and the Dow Jones Industrials. There are also bond index funds. These funds are very low cost, as they are passively managed. As discussed above, index funds almost always beat out actively managed funds in the long term. **Index funds are highly recommended and should form the backbone of your retirement plan.**  
For more information see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund) and [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/investing_mutualfunds.moneymag/index8.htm?iid=EL).
